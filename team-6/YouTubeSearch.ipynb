      "the thinking of u physicists and\n",

      "This is a special type of mathematical\n",

      "outcomes of any measurements in our\n",
      "mathematical calculus will all be\n",

      "known as self adjoint operators.\n",
      "Although there's a technical issue there\n",
      "I won't get into. Uh finally the key\n",
      "point is that measurements are\n",
      "probabilistic. We may not be able to\n",
      "know for sure the outcome of a given\n",
      "measurement. Uh but we can predict the\n",
      "probability of those outcomes using a\n",
      "mathematical tool known as Borne's rule.\n",
      "Uh Borne's probability rule. And this\n",
      "allows us to predict if not with\n",
      "certainty not deterministically the\n",
      "outcomes of measurements. we know with\n",
      "some certainty what the probabilities of\n",
      "certain measurement outcomes should be.\n",
      "Now this is textbook quantum mechanics.\n",
      "Uh this is everything you need at the\n",
      "most basic levels to do textbook quantum\n",
      "mechanics. Uh but of course it says\n",
      "nothing about bzons or firmians uh\n",
      "symmetriized or so-called anti-ymmetized\n",
      "states. It doesn't give us quantum field\n",
      "theory and it certainly is in no state\n",
      "to reconcile the theory of quantum\n",
      "mechanics with something like gravity.\n",
      "Uh so even though this is textbook\n",
      "mechanic quantum mechanics in its closed\n",
      "form, of course the theory is um you\n",
      "know only limited to the very specific\n",
      "set of cases that it itself can describe\n",
      "at a textbook kind of level. And as we\n",
      "proceed through the lecture, we're going\n",
      "to see what the limitations of this very\n",
      "well-defined uh very accurate but\n",
      "ultimately limited\n",
      "theory. So here we are. What are the\n",
      "limits of orthodox quantum theory? Well,\n",
      "if Lord Calvin was around today, I think\n",
      "he would have similar concerns, he might\n",
      "even propose a third cloud hanging over\n",
      "the horizon of physics today. Now,\n",
      "Calvin was adamant in his view echoed by\n",
      "quantum theory uh that unless you can\n",
      "put a number on your knowledge that your\n",
      "knowledge is of a meager and\n",
      "unsatisfactory kind. uh this is kind of\n",
      "a preliminary to um Heisenberg's idea\n",
      "that all physical quantities must be\n",
      "observable and if we can make\n",
      "measurements we can express those\n",
      "measurements in numbers. So in many way\n",
      "Heisenberg's theory was a direct\n",
      "consequence of an idea that Kelvin had\n",
      "proposed the previous century. Now what\n",
      "is interesting about this is if you look\n",
      "back at the old dialogues uh between\n",
      "Dyra and Heisenberg for example they had\n",
      "their views about what really comprised\n",
      "a theory um or what a theory should be\n",
      "composed of and Durk felt that theory\n",
      "should be open and uh subject to\n",
      "revision whereas Heisenberg thought no\n",
      "once you have a theory it should be\n",
      "closed and complete in the sense that\n",
      "that theory's uh domain applicability\n",
      "should be clearly defined and if there\n",
      "were future discoveries or revolutions\n",
      "in physics, it wouldn't be a\n",
      "modification to the old theory. It would\n",
      "be in fact the creation of a whole new\n",
      "theory with a new domain. Uh so they\n",
      "didn't really agree on what a theory\n",
      "should be open or closed. But one thing\n",
      "they could agree on uh was that the\n",
      "development of quantum theory should not\n",
      "make use of classical mechanics. And in\n",
      "fact uh Heisenberg was adamant that new\n",
      "phenomena require the formation of a new\n",
      "closed theory. Uh so the real issue here\n",
      "if we now look a little more closely at\n",
      "what is really entailed in quantum\n",
      "mechanics is that we have this postulate\n",
      "about measurement that requires the\n",
      "existence of a measurement device. And\n",
      "unfortunately for quantum theory or for\n",
      "our conceptualization of quantum theory,\n",
      "the measurement device itself is not\n",
      "described by quantum mechanics either\n",
      "then in the 1920s or even today. Uh\n",
      "quantum mechanics fails to describe the\n",
      "measurement apparatus itself. And we\n",
      "have to assume that the apparatus or the\n",
      "experimenters doing the measurement are\n",
      "somehow classical objects. Even though\n",
      "of course uh laboratories and apparatus\n",
      "and experimenters are all made of the\n",
      "same atoms, electrons, nuclei and so\n",
      "forth that uh we have in our quantum\n",
      "physics experiments themselves. So\n",
      "there's a kind of incompleteness in\n",
      "quantum mechanics due to the fact that\n",
      "we have these beautiful postulates that\n",
      "define the mathematics of quantum theory\n",
      "in this abstract sense. But in order to\n",
      "actually predict results of our\n",
      "calculations, we need to add this\n",
      "classical measuring apparatus in by\n",
      "hand. And uh this kind of ad hoc\n",
      "addition to the theory has been very\n",
      "troubling to physicists throughout the\n",
      "decades since quantum mechanics was\n",
      "developed. Of course uh quantum\n",
      "mechanics has still has problems in\n",
      "terms of its relationship to relativity.\n",
      "um we have uh some versions of quantum\n",
      "electronamics uh that are compatible\n",
      "with relativity but to go to full-blown\n",
      "quantum gravity uh of course this is\n",
      "still a major open project uh a grand\n",
      "challenge in physics and so this\n",
      "measurement problem this idea that we\n",
      "have a quantum system that evolves\n",
      "unitarily in time uh we can predict uh\n",
      "certain expectation values you know\n",
      "certain\n",
      "um likely results or average results of\n",
      "of the experiments we perform on these\n",
      "quantum systems all still hinges on the\n",
      "existence of this seemingly classical\n",
      "device uh that can somehow collapse the\n",
      "wave function so to speak to get this\n",
      "probabilistic superposition of possible\n",
      "outcomes narrowed down to a single\n",
      "actual outcome that we observe during\n",
      "any experimental setup.\n",
      "So there's a real divide between the\n",
      "quantum and classical realms. Quantum\n",
      "mechanics and classical physics are in\n",
      "some way incompatible even though we\n",
      "think on at least in some limit. One\n",
      "theory should be a special case of the\n",
      "other. Classical phenomena are assumed\n",
      "to emerge from underlying quantum\n",
      "systems as you add more and more atoms\n",
      "and the system gets bigger as you\n",
      "approach the macroscopic limit. And this\n",
      "assumption is known as the\n",
      "correspondence principle that on some\n",
      "level quantum phenomena should\n",
      "correspond to macroscopic classical\n",
      "effects. However, quantum mechanics as\n",
      "I've mentioned is incomplete without\n",
      "classical theory. We have to\n",
      "assume classical measuring devices in\n",
      "order to carry out our measurement\n",
      "calculus and predict the results of our\n",
      "experiments. Uh so rather than being\n",
      "able to derive classical physics from\n",
      "quantum theory as the founders of\n",
      "quantum mechanics like bore and\n",
      "Heisenberg expected classical theory is\n",
      "a required a prerequisite of quantum\n",
      "mechanics and this from a theoretical\n",
      "point of view is very problematic. If\n",
      "you look at Einstein's relativity for\n",
      "example, uh Newtonian physics, uh\n",
      "Newtonian kinematics are a special case\n",
      "of Einstein's special relativity and the\n",
      "limit where things move slowly. Uh but\n",
      "the limit where things get big enough\n",
      "that quantum systems become classical\n",
      "has still never actually been formally\n",
      "mathematically defined with any rigor.\n",
      "And so we still have this enormous gap\n",
      "between the quantum and classical which\n",
      "has not been bridged in anything but a\n",
      "kind of um ad hoc uh speculative sense.\n",
      "Now we know that quantum systems are\n",
      "quantum and classical systems are\n",
      "classical but where we draw the line is\n",
      "unclear and in fact that line drawing\n",
      "step is known as the Heisenberg cut. um\n",
      "which in some view some people's view is\n",
      "completely\n",
      "arbitrary. But we can think of systems\n",
      "that bridge the gap between quantum and\n",
      "classical. Uh classical systems uh\n",
      "according to one estimate by Bassie and\n",
      "co-workers in the review of modern\n",
      "physics uh can be trusted. uh classical\n",
      "systems we see uh for objects on the\n",
      "scale of um micrograms or larger uh\n",
      "objects as heavy as 10 the 6 g or\n",
      "bigger. Whereas quantum effects can be\n",
      "expected\n",
      "to ultimately uh govern the dynamics of\n",
      "our system for very small objects on the\n",
      "scale of uh about a zepptogram or less.\n",
      "That's 10 ^ of -21 g. So for a\n",
      "physicist, you can see right away there\n",
      "are 15 orders of magnitude gap between\n",
      "the kinds of systems we can treat as\n",
      "decisively classical and the kind of\n",
      "systems that we should consider\n",
      "unequivocably quantum. And so the\n",
      "question of how to negotiate this\n",
      "quantum classical divide as I mentioned\n",
      "is still unanswered. Uh the physicist\n",
      "just does this division in his mind. Uh\n",
      "separating\n",
      "the quantum system under study from the\n",
      "classical laboratory apparatus, the\n",
      "knobs he turns and buttons he presses.\n",
      "And this uh artificial separation, the\n",
      "Heisenberg cut so to speak, is good\n",
      "enough for most of our applications when\n",
      "we clearly know in our laboratory the\n",
      "difference between the system we're\n",
      "studying and the seemingly classical\n",
      "apparatus that we use to study it. Now,\n",
      "one of the reasons I became interested\n",
      "in biology was because of course biology\n",
      "a priority from first principles has no\n",
      "such artificial boundary. If we look at\n",
      "the scale from zepptograms to\n",
      "micrograms, uh, biological systems,\n",
      "living organisms have stuff going on at\n",
      "every scale all the way from individual\n",

      "various components of the cells, and\n",

      "they literally have things going on all\n",
      "the way down or all the way up if you\n",
      "start from first principles.\n",
      "Now beginning from first principles uh\n",
      "Schroinger for example in the 1940\n",
